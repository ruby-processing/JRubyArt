   * Returns the Perlin noise value at specified coordinates. Perlin noise is
   * a random sequence generator producing a more natural ordered, harmonic
   * succession of numbers compared to the standard <b>random()</b> function.
   * It was invented by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in
   * graphical applications to produce procedural textures, natural motion,
   * shapes, terrains etc. The main difference to the
   * <b>random()</b> function is that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite
   * n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates corresponds to a
   * fixed semi-random value (fixed only for the lifespan of the program).
   * The resulting value will always be between 0.0 and 1.0. Processing can
   * compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise, depending on the number of coordinates
   * given. The noise value can be animated by moving through the noise space
   * as demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd and 3rd dimension can also
   * be interpreted as time. The actual noise is structured
   * similar to an audio signal, in respect to the function's use of
   * frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in physics, perlin
   * noise is computed over several octaves which are added together for the
   * final result. Another way to adjust the character of the
   * resulting sequence is the scale of the input coordinates. As the
   * function works within an infinite space the value of the coordinates
   * doesn't matter as such, only the distance between successive coordinates
   * does (eg. when using <b>noise()</b> within a loop). As a general rule
   * the smaller the difference between coordinates, the smoother the
   * resulting noise sequence will be. Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most
   * applications, but this will differ depending on use.

   * Adjusts the character and level of detail produced by the Perlin noise
   * function. Similar to harmonics in physics, noise is computed over
   * several octaves. Lower octaves contribute more to the output signal and
   * as such define the overal intensity of the noise, whereas higher octaves
   * create finer grained details in the noise sequence. By default, noise is
   * computed over 4 octaves with each octave contributing exactly half than
   * its predecessor, starting at 50% strength for the 1st octave. This
   * falloff amount can be changed by adding an additional function
   * parameter. Eg. a falloff factor of 0.75 means each octave will now have
   * 75% impact (25% less) of the previous lower octave. Any value between
   * 0.0 and 1.0 is valid, however note that values greater than 0.5 might
   * result in greater than 1.0 values returned by <b>noise()</b>.
   * By changing these parameters, the signal created by the <b>noise()</b>
   * function can be adapted to fit very specific needs and characteristics.
