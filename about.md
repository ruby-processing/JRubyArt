  - [JRubyArt](https://github.com/ruby-processing/JRubyArt) allows you to code [processing](https://processing.org/) sketches in regular ruby (it supersedes ruby-processing for processing-3.0+).

  - Vanilla processing is essentially Java with an antlr[^1]
    pre-processor to make writing code simpler (in the processing ide), although it is debatable whether whether `color` should have ever been a type!!!.

    [^1]: ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files.

  - [JRubyArt](https://github.com/ruby-processing/JRubyArt) is able to emulate the simplicity of vanilla processing, by using JRuby[^2] to load regular processing jars into a ruby runtime environment.

  [^2]: JRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language atop the Java Virtual Machine

  - You can write JRubyArt code in any editor that supports ruby syntax, however the [atom](https://atom.io/) editor[^3] has a plugin that allows you to run / watch processing sketches without leaving the editor.
  [^3]: A hackable text editor for the 21st Century

  - Vim[^4] and
  [^4]: Vim is a highly configurable text editor for efficiently creating and changing any kind of text and Emacs[^5] can also run sketches without leaving the editor
[^5]: The features of GNU Emacs include. Content-aware editing modes, including syntax coloring, for many file types. Complete built-in documentation in addition both can be used to edit live JRubyArt code live from pry[^6].
[^6]: Pry is a powerful alternative to the standard IRB shell for Ruby. It is written from scratch to provide a number of advanced features
