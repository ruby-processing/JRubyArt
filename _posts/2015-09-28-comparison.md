JRubyArt is actively being developed, ruby-processing should be considered to be deprecated and is no-longer actively maintained.  The only possible justification to prefer to use ruby-processing is to be compatible with processing-2.2.1. So since January 2017 table below has been modified to address what you need to know, now that you have decided to switch from ruby-processing to JRubyArt

The `settings` method was introduced to vanilla processing since processing-3.0. However this is hidden for users of the [processing ide][settings] but required by Eclipse users. The `settings` method is where `size` belongs or `full_screen`, also you should set `smooth` and `pixel_density` here. Retina users can make use of their hi-dpi display by setting `pixel_density(2)`, NB: size should be first line of `settings`, and if used `pixel_density(2)` should be next.

In JRubyArt use the `data_path` wrapper to return the absolute path for the `data` folder [see here][here] (this means `--nojruby` flag is obsolete since even shader sketches should now run with an installed jruby). Set `JRUBY: false` in config.yml to use jruby-complete instead of an installed jruby (crucial if you haven't installed jruby on your system).
