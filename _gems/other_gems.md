# Using the ai4r gem in ruby-processing.
# A simple example that demonstrates using
# a backpropagation neural network. Use the drop box menu to
# select a prebuilt shape. To draw a test shape tick drawing checkbox,
# release the mouse when drawing a discontinous shape eg cross.
# Clear the sketch with clear button.
# Press evaluate and result is printed to the console....
