# JRubyArt
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jruby_art.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/jruby_art)
![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ruby-processing/JRubyArt.svg)
Versions before JRubyArt-1.2.0, are unsupported, please update, preferably to latest version...

_Note the main reason for the current build to fail on travis is when the current version of [processing is not available from maven central][testing], it has only ever been available by third parties (I am eternally hopeful that one day processing.org will see the light), actually rvm with jruby as used by travis-ci is also pretty crap as judged by the build traces._

## Requirements
A clean start for `jruby_art` that works best with the latest version of [processing-3.3.2](https://github.com/processing/processing/releases) and [jruby-9.1.8.0](http://jruby.org/download) see [wiki](https://github.com/ruby-processing/JRubyArt/wiki/Building-latest-gem) for building gem from this repo.  Changes from processing-2.0 to [processing-3.0 here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0). Should work on same platforms as vanilla processing (windows, mac, linux) for Android see Yuki Morohoshi [rubuto-processing3][].
## Requirements

A suitable version of ruby (MRI `ruby 2.3+` or `jruby-9.1.8.0+`) to download gem.

`processing-3.3.2`

`jdk1.8.0_121+` can be openjdk with OpenJFX _a separate download works on ArchLinux_, currently FX2D is experimental is expected to replace JAVA2D in the near future see changes above...

### recommended installs (JRubyArt is currently hard-coded to expect them)

processing `video` and `sound-1.3.2+` libraries _best installed from the processing-3.3 ide_


## Configuration

You can if you wish leave configuration to the `new` autoconfig tool (delete existing config to do this). The config file is `config.yml` in the `~/.jruby_art folder`, the autoconfig gets run on `k9 --install` expected to just work on `macOS`, output may need tuning on `windows` / `linux` check with `k9 --check` (run both after gem install for both)

```yaml
# YAML configuration file for jruby_art
# K9_HOME: "/home/ruby2.3.0 ... /jruby_art" # windows users may need to set this
PROCESSING_ROOT: "/home/tux/processing-3.3.2" # typical linux shown
# important sketch_book path may be different for processing-3.0
sketchbook_path: "/home/tux/sketchbook"
template: bare
sketch_title: 'Edit Static Sketch' # for static sketch only
width: 600 # for static sketch only
height: 600 # for static sketch only
```

## Install Steps (assumes you have requirements above)

```bash
 gem install jruby_art
 k9 --install # installs jruby-complete-9.1.8.0 and downloads and installs samples to ~/k9_samples
 cd ~/k9_samples/contributed
 k9 --run jwishy.rb # if you have jruby-9.1.8.0 installed or config `JRUBY: false`
 # to use jruby-complete set `JRUBY: false` in config
```
## Create sketches from built in templates
```bash
k9 --create fred 200 200                # basic sketch fred.rb
k9 --create fred 200 200 p2d            # basic P2D sketch fred.rb
```
To create either a `class` wrapped sketch or `emacs` sketch set `template: class` or `template: emacs` in config.yml

## Simple Sketch
```ruby
# :sketch_title belongs in --it is a convenience method of jruby_art-3.0+
def setup
  sketch_title 'My Sketch'
end

def draw
  background 0
  fill 200
  ellipse width / 2, height / 2, 300, 200
end

# NB: changes for processing-3.0+
# size, full_screen, pixel_density and smooth should all be moved to settings (this is hidden
# to users of processing ide, but not for JRubyArt, or for Eclipse NetBeans users). The FX2D
# rendering mode was introduced, and was expected to replace JAVA2D (as default rendering mode)
# but may not now happen, and not for processing-3.3 in any case.
def settings
  size 400, 300
end
```
## Run Sketch
See above
be prepared to `KILL` the odd java process (ie when sketch does not exit cleanly)

## Watch sketches
```bash
k9 --watch sketch.rb # don't try and change render mode, or use FX2D render mode during watch yet
```
## Open pry console on sketch
```bash
k9 --live sketch.rb # pry is bound to $app # needs `jruby -S gem install pry`
```
## Example sketches

[Worked Examples](https://github.com/ruby-processing/JRubyArt-examples) more to follow, feel free to add your own, especially ruby-2.2+ syntax now we can. These can now be downloaded using `k9 --install` please move existing `k9_samples` if you wish to keep them.

## Conversion Tool

I wrote this little script to convert sketches from ruby-processing (processing-2) to jruby_art (processing-3.0) [here](https://gist.github.com/monkstone/1a658bdda4ea21c204c5).

See The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-in-Ruby converted to [The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-for-JRubyArt](https://github.com/ruby-processing/The-Nature-of-Code-for-JRubyArt) using the script.
